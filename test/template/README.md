# Template Guidelines

* Select the template which fits your testcase best
* Insert a unique id (int) the startdate (DDMMYYYY) of the test and once finished replace live with success or failed
* If none fits create a new one from scratch but structured like the others
* If you miss fields in existing templates add them if they are not redundant
* Never remove existing entries for backwards compatablity
